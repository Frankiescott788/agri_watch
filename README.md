# Agri Watch

## Overview
Agri Watch was presented at the Limpopo 3rd Annual Varsity Hackathon, hosted by the University of Venda, University of Limpopo, and Tshwane University of Technology. While the project received strong feedback and recognition for its innovative approach to transforming the agricultural sector, it did not take home the win.

The application combines Artificial Intelligence and IoT with traditional farming practices, providing farmers with tools such as crop monitoring, weather integration, pest and disease alerts, and resource management to optimize farming processes and promote sustainability.

### Objective
To bridge the gap between modern technology and traditional farming practices, making agriculture smarter, more efficient, and sustainable.

## Features
- **Crop Monitoring:** Provides real-time updates on crop health using satellite imagery and sensor data.
- **Weather Integration:** Displays hyper-local weather forecasts to help farmers make informed decisions about planting and harvesting.
- **Pest and Disease Alerts:** AI-driven alerts to warn farmers about potential pest infestations or crop diseases.
- **Resource Management:** Tracks the usage of water, fertilizers, and other resources to ensure sustainable farming practices.
- **Predictive Analytics:** Uses AI models to predict crop yields based on current conditions and historical data.
- **Community Forums:** A platform for farmers to share experiences, solutions, and farming techniques.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Firebase
- **Other Tools:**
  - TypeScript for type safety
  - Leaflet.js for interactive mapping
